# Google Summer of Code - Ideas List

## FHIR Integration

Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is a standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically. Goal is to integrate a FHIR server and client with OpenEMR to allow importing and exporting of patient data.

* Mentors: Jerry Padgett, Stephen Nielson
* Tags: New Feature


## Standardized Patient Data

Goal is to develop a mechanism to create and import large datasets of standardized patient data. This is a high impact project that would then markedly improve instructional use of OpenEMR and markedly improve OpenEMR's use in the data analytics field.

* Mentors: Robert Down, Brady Miller
* Tags: New Feature 


## Quality Reporting

Quality reporting and collection of clinical metrics are a valuable tool for clinics. It allows self-assessment, quality improvement projects, and reporting of metrics to regulation entities. Goal is to integrate quality reporting into OpenEMR. Note this project will involve both choosing of which clinical metrics to assess and then developing these in OpenEMR.

* Mentors: Ray Magauran, Stephen Waite
* Tags: New Feature


## Upgrade Smarty2 to Smarty3

A minor, albeit critical part of the codebase uses Smarty. The goal of this project is to migrate this code from using Smarty version 2 to Smarty version 3. This is critical for "future proofing" of OpenEMR's codebase since Smarty version 2 will be deprecated in the future.

* Mentors: Brady Miller, Roberto Vasquez
* Tags: Modernization 


## Standardize PDF Tools

OpenEMR currently uses several different PDF tools and libraries, which complicates code development. Goal is to standardize all PDF output from a common PDF library.

* Mentors: Roberto Vasquez, Jerry Padgett
* Tags: Optimization 


## PACS Server Integration

Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) is a system that allows storing and viewing of patient imaging, such as Xrays, CT scans, and ultrasounds. Goal is it integrate a PACS server with OpenEMR to allow the viewing and storage of patient imaging.

* Mentors: Robert Down, Asher Densmore-Lynn
* Tags: New Feature 


## Upgrade Codebase to Use Services

Since OpenEMR began in 2002, there are parts of the codebase that are crying out for modernization. The goal of this project is to lead a modernization effort that focuses on modern use of classes and services.

* Mentors: Robert Down, Rod Roark
* Tags: Modernization 


## Support MAR

A Medication Administration Record (MAR) is a record of all medications that are given to a patient while they are in a hospital or nursing home facility. OpenEMR currently supports a medication list and writing prescriptions, however, OpenEMR does not support a MAR. Goal is to implement a MAR in OpenEMR.

* Mentors: Stephen Waite, Robert Down
* Tags: New Feature 


## Integrate Telehealth

Telehealth is increasingly being used in healthcare and while OpenEMR does support a patient portal and communication with physicians via secure messaging or chat, OpenEMR does not yet support Telehealth. The goal is to support telehealth in OpenEMR.

## Custom proposal

The community is also very open to custom proposals. Check out the [OpenEMR Project Roadmap](https://www.open-emr.org/wiki/index.php/Roadmaps#OpenEMR_Project_Roadmap) and [Issue in Github](https://github.com/openemr/openemr/issues) for some more ideas, and highly recommend discussing your ideas on the [OpenEMR forum](https://community.open-emr.org/) or [OpenEMR chat](https://www.open-emr.org/chat) and/or contacting a mentor directly.
